The physics department at UVA offers three different degrees. The Bachelors of Arts in Physics (B.A), The Bachelors of Science in Physics (B.S), and the Bachelors of Science in Astrophysics jointly with the Astronomy department (B.S). Depending on what kind of degree you are seeking will determine what courses you should think about taking. Of course you should consult your undergrad advisor for their advice on picking courses. 

Here is the link to the pdf the department has that more information about the physics program and an example of a typical course schedule for each degree. [Major Brochure 2018-2019](http://www.phys.virginia.edu/Education/Programs/MajorBrochure/default.pdf)

Here are some summaries/descriptions of courses that are required/typically offered:

        This is often the first physics class someone will take when they begin the physics major at UVA. It is a calculus based introduction that covers the following topics: kinematics, mechanics, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and simple harmonic motion. This class is 5 credit course (4 credit lecture) and includes a 1 credit discussion session.

This class is an introduction into the C programming language and its purpose is to familiarize students to solving basic physics problems using programming. In this class you will learn the use of external libraries, implementation of basic algorithms with focus on numerical methods, and error analysis & data fitting. Lecture meets once a week and there is a lab session every week. 
<br>
<br>
A fair warning about this course: the material starts off really easy but it progressively gets more difficult, especially the final project. You can ask anyone who took this course and they will all tell you the same thing... START THE FINAL EARLY!

This is usually the first of the core classes that physics majors take and entails a more in-depth and advanced investigation of classical physics. The course begins with an overview of topics covered in PHYS 1710 (kinematics, momentum, and energy) but now with the knowledge of multivariable calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra. Then students are introduced into Lagrangian formalism and the calculus of variations, followed by orbits, rotational motion of rigid bodies, and coupled spring problems.

Intermediate lab 1 and 2 are the same course, just offered during different semesters. These courses are designed to teach students on how to run more complicated and modern experiments that are based on quantum mechanics, solid state physics, and optics. Students will also learn on how to write extensive and thorough lab reports that require reading peer reviwed literature. Students will be paired up in partners and will choose 5 experiments to do that take about 2.5 weeks each. You will write a lab report for 4 of them and will then present the last one for a presentation grade.

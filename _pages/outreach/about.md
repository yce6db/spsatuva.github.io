Since Spring 2018, we have been working with Clark Elementary School's CLASS afterschool program to bring physics to local Charlottesville children! We volunteered with them once a week, performing hands on demos with them that were meant to introduce them to physics concepts such as buoyancy, properties of light, forces, and the universe. We also collaborated with UVA's Dark Skys Bright Kids organization to bring a planetarium to the school.

The UVA physics department hosts two demo days per year: one in the Spring semester, the [National Physics Day Show](http://www.phys.virginia.edu/Announcements/PhysicsDay/) (which sometimes gets [press coverage](https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-invents-national-physics-day-anew-each-year)), and one in the summer, as a part of the [BLAST summer camp](https://blast.spacegrant.org/). In these demo shows, UVA physics majors partner up with professors to design and perform demonstrations for a large audience of ~100 children and adults.

If you are interested in being involved with these program, you can either [contact us](/contact/) or [contact the organizer](mailto:sackett@virginia.edu) for the show directly to get more information.

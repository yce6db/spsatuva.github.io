# About

**aNoether Physics Club**, a Women in Physics initiative named after the illustrious Emmy Noether, is dedicated to empowering the next generation of trailblazing women in physics. In addition to assisting women in overcoming obstacles preventing them from equitable, successful, and gratifying careers, we believe it is also of paramount importance to provide support for all underrepresented physicists and their allies. For this reason, we aim to organize events and activities that will foster a thoroughly inclusive sense of community to all physics majors fighting for a sense of belonging. Our work falls mainly under three categories:

### Career guidance

We work to ensure all students have equal access to information and resources that aid them in their pursuit of careers in physics

### Outreach

We are dedicated to sharing our love for physics with the next generation, helping minority students to envision themselves as physicists and mathematicians 

### Social events

We want to encourage camaraderie between graduate and undergraduate students, providing opportunities for all aspiring physicists to encourage and inspire one another 

Please feel free to reach out with any questions or comments, and we hope to see you at one of our events sometime soon!
